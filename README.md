# liri-node-app

## What the project does: 
Liri is a text based virtual assistant using several npm installed modules to perform searches against the following APIs:

	* Spotify
	* OMDB
	* Twitter

and displays the results to the console.

## Why the project is useful:
Who likes *talking* to their phones all day long, when they are just a repo clone, node install and 3 npm installs away from typing all the requests they want. :-)

## How users can get started with the project:
Clone away. The json files to guide you to the required modules are ready to go! You'll need to provide your own .env and .keys files with the API keys for your accounts to get started.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
This is all me. Feel free to fork and PR all you like! I'll take the help.

## Open issues
Still working on parsing the Spotify API reponses into something useful.
